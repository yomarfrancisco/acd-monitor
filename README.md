## Overview

ACD Monitor is a comprehensive cryptocurrency market surveillance system that detects bilateral collusion patterns, analyzes microstructure dynamics, and provides regulatory compliance reporting.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Capture**: Live tick data from 5 major exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Bybit)
- **Bilateral Collusion Detection**: Identifies potential coordination between venue pairs
- **Microstructure Analysis**: InfoShare, Spread Convergence, Lead-Lag analysis
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated evidence generation and compliance reporting
- **Pairwise Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of all 10 possible venue combinations

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run live capture
python src/acd/capture/overlap_orchestrator.py --pair BTC-USD --export-dir exports --verbose

# Run pairwise analysis
python scripts/run_pairwise_analysis.py --export-dir exports/sweep_recon_best2_live --verbose
```

## Key Components

### Capture System
- **Overlap Orchestrator**: Concurrent data capture with strict overlap detection
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Heartbeat tracking and status reporting
- **Data Persistence**: Parquet-based storage with time-based partitioning

### Analysis Pipeline
- **InfoShare Analysis**: Information leadership detection
- **Spread Convergence**: Coordinated trading pattern identification
- **Lead-Lag Analysis**: Cross-venue timing relationships

### Regulatory Reporting
- **Evidence Bundles**: Comprehensive analysis results
- **Decision Logging**: Automated regulatory flagging
- **Provenance Tracking**: Complete audit trail

## Recent Findings

### Bilateral Collusion Detection
- **binance+bybit**: Clear bilateral collusion detected (InfoShare=0.602, Coordination=0.860)
- **Threshold Breaches**: Multiple pairs exceed regulatory thresholds
- **Market Impact**: Significant coordination patterns identified

### Pairwise Analysis Results
- **Total Pairs Analyzed**: 10 possible venue combinations
- **Successful Analyses**: 12 bundles (6 pairs Ã— 2 granularities)
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Comprehensive threshold analysis
