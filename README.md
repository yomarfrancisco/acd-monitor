# Algorithmic Coordination Diagnostic (ACD)

The Algorithmic Coordination Diagnostic (ACD) is an **agent-driven monitoring system** that distinguishes legitimate algorithmic competition from anticompetitive coordination using empirically grounded econometric methods.

---

## Core Value

An intelligent agent that continuously monitors your pricing algorithms, detects coordination risks, and generates court-ready evidence — combining Brief 55+ methodology with natural-language reporting that regulators, compliance teams, and judges can immediately understand and act on.

---

## Dual Pillars

1. **Empirical Rigor**  
   Built on Brief 55+, the ACD applies advanced econometrics and industrial organization models to diagnose algorithmic coordination.

2. **Regulatory Credibility**  
   Designed for defensibility in court and regulatory contexts, the methodology aligns with global antitrust standards.
