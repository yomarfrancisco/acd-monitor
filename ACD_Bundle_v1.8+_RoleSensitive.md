# **ACD Bundle v1.8+ + Role-Sensitive Framework**
## **Single Authoritative Reference for Algorithmic Coordination Diagnostic**

**Version**: 1.8+  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: SEC Pilot Ready with Statistical Adequacy  

---

## **1. Introduction & Purpose**

This document serves as the **single authoritative reference** for the Algorithmic Coordination Diagnostic (ACD) project, combining the v1.8+ Baseline Standard with a Role-Sensitive Reporting Framework. The ACD delivers a unified technical analysis that can be consumed differently by three key user roles while maintaining consistency and avoiding scope drift.

### **v1.8+ Statistical Adequacy Enhancement**
The v1.8+ Baseline Standard addresses reviewer feedback through:
- **100-Case Validation Library**: Enriched metadata with jurisdictional filtering
- **Statistical Adequacy Criteria**: Explicit validation methodology with reliability standards
- **SEC Pilot Focus**: Regulation ATS compliance and market manipulation prevention
- **Legal Framework Strengthening**: Jurisdiction-specific legal precision

### **Core Principle**
All role-sensitive reports are **re-presentations of the v1.8+ data layer**, not new analyses. The v1.8+ Baseline Standard provides the authoritative technical foundation, while role-sensitive frameworks adapt the presentation and focus to meet specific user needs.

### **Document Structure**
1. **Baseline Summary (v1.8+ Surveillance Report)** - Authoritative technical layer
2. **Role-Sensitive Reporting Framework** - Three user role adaptations
3. **Flow Between Roles** - Handoff and escalation protocols
4. **Example Skeleton Reports** - Illustrative outputs for each role
5. **Guardrails & Governance** - Consistency and scope management
6. **v1.8+ Extensions** - Statistical adequacy criteria and SEC pilot focus
