# Font Files Required

## American Typewriter Light

**File needed**: `AmericanTypewriter-Light.woff2`

**Instructions**:
1. Obtain the American Typewriter Light font file
2. Convert it to WOFF2 format if needed
3. Place it in this directory as `AmericanTypewriter-Light.woff2`

**Alternative**: If you don't have access to American Typewriter Light, you can:
1. Use a similar serif font like "Times New Roman" or "Georgia"
2. Update the font import in `app/layout.tsx` to use a web font instead
3. Or use a system font fallback

**Current implementation**: The headline will fall back to the default serif font until the American Typewriter Light font file is added.
