  "recommendations": [
    "VMM convergence rate below 80% - consider adjusting tolerance or learning rate",
    "Data quality below 80% - investigate data source issues",
    "This is a demo calibration - real-world deployment requires actual market data",
    "VMM thresholds should be tuned based on specific market characteristics",
    "Regular recalibration is recommended as market conditions change"
