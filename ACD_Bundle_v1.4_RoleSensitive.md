## **Single Authoritative Reference for Algorithmic Coordination Diagnostic**

**Version**: 1.4  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Production Ready  

---

## **1. Introduction & Purpose**

This document serves as the **single authoritative reference** for the Algorithmic Coordination Diagnostic (ACD) project, combining the v1.4 Baseline Standard with a Role-Sensitive Reporting Framework. The ACD delivers a unified technical analysis that can be consumed differently by three key user roles while maintaining consistency and avoiding scope drift.

### **Core Principle**
All role-sensitive reports are **re-presentations of the v1.4 data layer**, not new analyses. The v1.4 Baseline Standard provides the authoritative technical foundation, while role-sensitive frameworks adapt the presentation and focus to meet specific user needs.

### **Document Structure**
1. **Baseline Summary (v1.4 Surveillance Report)** - Authoritative technical layer
2. **Role-Sensitive Reporting Framework** - Three user role adaptations
3. **Flow Between Roles** - Handoff and escalation protocols
4. **Example Skeleton Reports** - Illustrative outputs for each role
5. **Guardrails & Governance** - Consistency and scope management

## **2. Baseline Summary (v1.4 Surveillance Report)**

### **2.1 Technical Foundation**
The v1.4 Baseline Standard provides the authoritative technical analysis for cross-venue coordination detection in crypto markets, specifically BTC/USD across Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.

### **2.2 Core Metrics**
- **Depth-Weighted Cosine Similarity**: Top-50 order book levels with exponential depth weighting
- **Jaccard Index**: Order placement overlap with 1000ms time window and price/size bucketing
- **Price Correlation**: Mid-price returns correlation analysis
- **Composite Coordination Score**: Weighted aggregation (50% depth, 30% Jaccard, 20% correlation)

### **2.3 Adaptive Baseline**
- **14-day rolling median** with robust outlier filtering
- **Structural break detection**: Bai-Perron, CUSUM, Page-Hinkley tests
- **Baseline calibration**: ~44% expected median with tolerance for real-data drift

### **2.4 Statistical Framework**
- **Power Analysis**: Minimum detectable effect sizes (15pp/20pp/25pp)
- **False Positive Rates**: Low (12%), Normal (18%), High (25%) volatility regimes
- **Confidence Intervals**: Bootstrap-based with Newey-West robust standard errors

### **2.5 Entity Intelligence**
- **Counterparty Concentration**: Top-5 accounts by coordination activity
- **Attribution Confidence**: High/Medium/Requires Verification framework
- **Network Analysis**: Clustering coefficient, centrality metrics
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Timing, sizing, cancellation coordination

### **2.6 Operational Integration**
- **4-tier risk framework**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **21-day phased investigation protocol**
