# **ACD Bundle v1.6 + Role-Sensitive Framework**
## **Single Authoritative Reference for Algorithmic Coordination Diagnostic**

**Version**: 1.6  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Deployment Ready  

---

## **1. Introduction & Purpose**

This document serves as the **single authoritative reference** for the Algorithmic Coordination Diagnostic (ACD) project, combining the v1.6 Baseline Standard with a Role-Sensitive Reporting Framework. The ACD delivers a unified technical analysis that can be consumed differently by three key user roles while maintaining consistency and avoiding scope drift.

### **v1.6 Enhancements**
The v1.6 Baseline Standard extends v1.5 with three critical additions for deployment readiness:
- **Case-Backed Threshold Validation**: Direct linkage to documented coordination cases
- **Jurisdiction-Specific CCO Adaptations**: Tailored compliance reports for SEC, MAS, BaFin
- **Integrated Legal Disclaimers**: Front-loaded legal boundaries in all role reports

### **Core Principle**
All role-sensitive reports are **re-presentations of the v1.6 data layer**, not new analyses. The v1.6 Baseline Standard provides the authoritative technical foundation, while role-sensitive frameworks adapt the presentation and focus to meet specific user needs.

### **Document Structure**
1. **Baseline Summary (v1.6 Surveillance Report)** - Authoritative technical layer
2. **Role-Sensitive Reporting Framework** - Three user role adaptations
3. **Flow Between Roles** - Handoff and escalation protocols
4. **Example Skeleton Reports** - Illustrative outputs for each role
5. **Guardrails & Governance** - Consistency and scope management
6. **v1.6 Extensions** - Case-backed validation and jurisdiction-specific adaptations
