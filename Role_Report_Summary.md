# **Role-Sensitive Reporting Framework Summary**
## **How Reports Interconnect and Maintain Consistency**

**Framework Version**: v1.4  
**Documentation Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Production Ready  

---

## **Overview**

The Role-Sensitive Reporting Framework demonstrates how a single v1.4 Baseline Standard analysis can be adapted for three distinct user roles while maintaining complete consistency and avoiding scope drift. All reports derive from the same technical foundation, ensuring unified analysis across the organization.

## **Report Interconnection Matrix**

| Report Type | Primary Audience | Data Source | Escalation Path | Key Focus |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Surveillance Report** | Head of Surveillance | v1.4 Baseline Standard | → CCO (24-72h) | Technical Analysis |
| **CCO Compliance Report** | Chief Compliance Officer | Surveillance Report | → Executive (7-14d) | Regulatory Compliance |
| **Executive Brief** | CEO/COO/Board | CCO Report | → Board (Quarterly) | Strategic Impact |

## **Data Flow Architecture**

### **Single Source of Truth**
```
v1.4 Baseline Standard (Technical Foundation)
    ↓
Surveillance Report (Technical Analysis)
    ↓
CCO Compliance Report (Regulatory Adaptation)
    ↓
Executive Brief (Strategic Adaptation)
```

**Key Principle**: Each report re-presents the same underlying data with role-appropriate focus and presentation, ensuring complete consistency across all stakeholders.

4. **Regulatory Consultation**: Standardized disclosure template preparation
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation for regulatory review

**Deliverables**:
- Technical analysis summary
- Risk assessment matrix
- Investigation protocol
- Regulatory consultation schedule

### **CCO → Executive Escalation (7-14 Days)**
**Trigger**: Critical findings requiring strategic decision-making

**Escalation Protocol**:
1. **CCO Assessment**: Compliance impact and regulatory exposure evaluation
2. **Executive Briefing**: Strategic risk summary with business impact
3. **Decision Matrix**: Risk scores linked to approval authorities
4. **Strategic Response**: Competitive positioning and reputational risk management
5. **Board Notification**: Quarterly risk assessment integration

**Deliverables**:
- Compliance impact assessment
- Strategic risk summary
- Business impact analysis
- Competitive positioning recommendations
