# User Story â€” FNB CDS Market

**Context:**  
FNB's CDS desk faces scrutiny after spreads appeared to move in parallel with peers (Nedbank, ABSA). Regulators suspect coordination.

2. **Top tile:** "Coordination Risk: 14/100 (LOW RISK)" with 96.8% confidence.
3. **Real-time chart:** 18 months of CDS spreads (FNB vs peers), updating as new ticks arrive.
4. **Indicators tab:** 
   - Stability: 25 (normal volatility)
   - Synchronization: 18 (independent movement)
   - Environmental Sensitivity: 82 (strong adaptation to shocks)
5. **Events tab:** 
   - Brent crude +2.3% (medium impact, adaptive response)
   - SARB policy rate decision
   - ZAR depreciation >5%
6. **Reports tab:** Export PDF with:
   - Raw CDS data
   - Confidence scores
