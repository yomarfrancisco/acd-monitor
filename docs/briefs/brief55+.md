## Beyond the AI Conspiracy: A Diagnostic for Coordination
**August 2025**

## Executive Summary

Enforcement agencies face an acute challenge in distinguishing legitimate algorithmic competition from anticompetitive coordination. Current approaches rely on theoretical speculation without systematic methodology, creating regulatory uncertainty that chills innovation while potentially missing genuine coordination.

The Algorithmic Coordination Diagnostic (ACD) framework developed in this Brief provides objective, empirically grounded tools for this distinction. Drawing on advances in causal inference and continuous validation techniques, the ACD tests whether pricing relationships remain invariant across market environments — a key signature of coordination — or adapt dynamically as competitive conditions change.

This methodology is particularly powerful in data-intensive sectors (airlines, e-commerce, digital advertising, financial services) where algorithmic sophistication and data density enable robust statistical analysis. The framework offers competition authorities evidence-based investigation criteria, provides firms with compliance auditing tools, and gives courts analytically rigorous evidence that moves beyond superficial parallelism.

## Core Methodology: Dual Pillars

### Pillar 1: Environment Partitioning + Invariance Testing (ICP)

The traditional approach involves partitioning pricing data into distinct "environments" based on observable changes in market conditions. These environments vary by sector:

**Financial services:**
- Market volatility regimes affecting risk pricing
- Regulatory announcement periods changing compliance costs
- Liquidity stress episodes affecting funding costs
- Cross-border arbitrage opportunity windows
- Interest rate cycle positioning affecting deposit competition

The economic logic is straightforward: if algorithmic pricing reflects genuine competitive adaptation, firms' pricing relationships should vary across different market environments as they respond to different cost structures, demand conditions, and competitive pressures.

### Pillar 2: Continuous Monitoring & Dynamic Validation (VMM)

Building on advances in sequential inference and streaming validation techniques, the ACD framework incorporates continuous monitoring that eliminates many limitations of the baseline environment-partitioning approach.

Rather than requiring ex-ante specification of market environments, the continuous monitoring approach applies Variational Method of Moments (VMM) techniques adapted from financial risk management to detect structural deterioration in pricing relationships as it occurs.

**Key Advantages:**
- Real-time deterioration detection
- Endogenous environment discovery
- Dynamic confidence scoring
- Reduced gaming potential

### Invariance Testing

Both approaches apply Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) techniques to test whether price relationships between competitors remain structurally stable. This provides a formal statistical test for whether observed relationships are "invariant" (suggesting structural coordination) or "environment-sensitive" (consistent with competitive adaptation).

### Multi-Layer Validation

Robust application benefits from complementary validation approaches:
- Information flow analysis
- Network analysis
- Regime-switching detection
- Statistical confidence mapping

## Economic Foundation

The diagnostic framework rests on a fundamental asymmetry between competitive and coordinated conduct:

**Competitive firms** face genuine uncertainty about optimal responses to ongoing environmental changes, generating variation in competitive responses across different market environments.

**Coordinated firms** benefit from predictable (invariant) response patterns that provide focal points for sustained cooperation. Environmental sensitivity would destabilize coordination by creating ambiguity about appropriate responses.

**The economic principle:** coordination requires invariance; competition generates adaptation.

## Implementation & Validation

The framework gains credibility through retrospective application to known cases where coordination has been established through other means, including the CMA poster frames investigation (2015) and U.S. v. Airline Tariff Publishing Co.

## Conclusion

The ACD framework provides a structured, empirically grounded approach to distinguish competitive from coordinated algorithmic behaviour, equipping courts, regulators, and practitioners with objective evidence that enforcement has so far lacked.
