## 2. Audience & Pain Points

### Head of Surveillance
**Primary Pain Points**:
- **Spread Floor Persistence**: During high volatility, spread floors persist longer than expected, indicating potential coordination
- **Cross-Venue Mirroring**: Order books mirror across venues in suspicious patterns, suggesting coordinated market making
- **Latency-Arb Masking**: High-frequency trading patterns mask underlying coordination signals
- **False Positive Overload**: Current surveillance systems generate too many false positives, wasting investigation resources
- **Regulatory Exposure**: Risk of regulatory enforcement actions due to undetected coordination

**Operational Impact**:
- **Investigation Time**: Manual analysis of coordination patterns takes 4-6 hours per case
- **Resource Allocation**: 60% of surveillance team time spent on false positive investigations
- **Regulatory Risk**: Potential enforcement actions costing $10M+ in penalties and reputational damage

### Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)
**Primary Pain Points**:
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Need to demonstrate proactive surveillance to regulators
- **Case Documentation**: Manual case file creation is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Audit Trail Requirements**: Need complete provenance and audit trails for regulatory compliance
- **Alternative Explanations**: Must systematically consider non-coordination explanations
- **Escalation Procedures**: Need clear escalation paths for high-risk coordination signals

**Operational Impact**:
- **Compliance Burden**: Manual regulatory reporting takes 2-3 days per case
- **Audit Risk**: Incomplete documentation creates regulatory audit exposure
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited compliance team capacity for detailed case analysis

### Market Operations
**Primary Pain Points**:
- **Order-Book Quality**: Coordination degrades market quality and user experience
- **Market Maker Behavior**: Need to identify problematic market maker coordination patterns
- **Fee Tier Analysis**: VIP fee ladders may incentivize coordination behavior
- **Inventory Shocks**: Market maker inventory changes may trigger coordination signals
- **Operational Efficiency**: Need automated analysis to support trading operations

**Operational Impact**:
- **Market Quality**: Coordination reduces market efficiency and increases spreads
- **User Experience**: Poor market quality leads to user complaints and reduced trading volume
- **Operational Costs**: Manual analysis of market maker behavior is resource-intensive
