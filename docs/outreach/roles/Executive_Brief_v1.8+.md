## **Executive Summary**

**LEGAL DISCLAIMER**: This analysis provides surveillance intelligence and investigation triggers only. It does not constitute conclusive evidence of collusion or market manipulation. Statistical patterns require additional investigation and validation for legal or enforcement purposes. This report is designed for regulatory monitoring and market studies.

**Status**: AMBER alerts triggered twice in September
