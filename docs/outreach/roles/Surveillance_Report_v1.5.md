## **Limitations & Disclaimers (Enhanced for v1.5)**

### **Investigation Tool Positioning**
This analysis provides **investigation triggers only** and does not constitute conclusive evidence of collusion or market manipulation. Further investigation, including entity-level analysis and regulatory consultation, is required.

### **Attribution Constraints**
Entity attributions marked as "Requires Verification" necessitate KYC validation or subpoena power for confirmation. High and Medium confidence levels are based on coordination patterns and network analysis.

### **Statistical Uncertainty**
All metrics include confidence intervals and experimental flags. Sub-millisecond timing analysis is marked as `EXPERIMENTAL_ONLY` and excluded from primary risk scoring.

### **Regulatory Coordination**
This analysis is designed for regulatory monitoring and market studies. Escalation to litigation requires external evidence beyond statistical patterns.

### **Legal & Evidentiary Framework (v1.5)**
- **Surveillance Intelligence**: ACD outputs are investigation triggers, not legal evidence
- **Evidentiary Limitations**: Statistical patterns require additional validation
- **Legal Boundaries**: Clear distinction between surveillance and evidence
- **Escalation Guidance**: Appropriate protocols for CCOs and executives

### **Global Regulatory Compliance (v1.5)**
- **Multi-Jurisdiction**: SEC, FCA, BaFin, MAS, JFSA, CFTC compliance
- **Standardized Language**: Jurisdiction-specific regulatory requirements
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation for regulatory review
- **Investigation Protocols**: Global regulatory consultation procedures

---

## **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Activate 24/7 surveillance for identified entities
2. **Regulatory Consultation**: Schedule consultation within 72 hours
3. **Evidence Preservation**: Initiate audit trail documentation
4. **Legal Review**: Engage legal team for investigation protocol
5. **Global Compliance**: Coordinate multi-jurisdiction regulatory consultation

### **Follow-up Analysis**
1. **Entity-Level Investigation**: Deep-dive analysis of top-5 entities
2. **Cross-Venue Analysis**: Extended analysis to additional venues
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Historical pattern analysis over 30-day window
4. **Regulatory Reporting**: Prepare standardized disclosure templates
5. **Legal Framework**: Evidence preservation and litigation preparation
