## 8. Conclusion

The current outreach bundles have significant gaps that must be addressed before outreach execution. The critical gaps include:

1. **Candidate Specificity**: 0% specificity across all bundles
2. **Regulatory Language**: 20% regulatory terminology usage
3. **Compliance Fit**: 5% mandate alignment
4. **Evidence Base**: 0% specific case studies

These gaps represent high-risk factors that could lead to regulatory rejection or poor engagement. The refinement framework provides a structured approach to address these gaps and create regulator-ready, bank-ready, and academic-ready bundles.

Success in this refinement process is critical for successful pilot partner engagement and regulatory adoption.
