## 11. Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for refining the current outreach bundles into regulator-ready, bank-ready, and academic-ready versions. The plan addresses all critical gaps identified in the current bundle assessment and provides specific actions, timelines, and success criteria.

Success in this refinement process will ensure that outreach bundles are:
- **Regulator-Ready**: With specific regulatory language, evidence base, and compliance fit
- **Bank-Ready**: With appropriate policy language, research collaboration focus, and technical integration
- **Academic-Ready**: With research language, publication focus, and methodology development

The implementation plan provides a structured approach to achieve these goals and ensure successful pilot partner engagement.
