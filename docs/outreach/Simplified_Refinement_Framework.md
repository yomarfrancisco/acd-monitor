## 11. Conclusion

This simplified framework provides a focused, practical approach for refining outreach bundles into regulator-ready, bank-ready, and academic-ready versions. The framework emphasizes:

- **3-phase refinement loop** instead of 6-phase complexity
- **Realistic evidence targets** (2-3 case studies vs. 5+)
- **Named statute mapping** (Dodd-Frank, Basel III, PFMA, etc.)
- **Parallel execution** where possible to compress timeline
- **Quality over quantity** in evidence development

The simplified approach addresses the over-engineering concerns while maintaining the essential elements needed for successful pilot partner engagement.
