# Agent Architecture - Landing Page Hero Content

## For Future Documentation Publishing

When publishing documentation, lift the README's "Agent Architecture" section as the landing page hero content.

### Source Content (from README.md)

```markdown
## Agent Architecture

- **Continuous Intelligence**: 5-minute monitoring cycles with natural-language risk summaries  
- **Contextual Reporting**: Automatically generates court-ready explanations of findings  
- **Proactive Alerting**: Early warning system with business-friendly risk classifications  
- **Evidence Generation**: Timestamped, cryptographically verified audit trails  
```

### Usage Notes

- This content effectively communicates the agent's core capabilities
- Emphasizes the intelligent, automated nature of the system
- Highlights key value propositions for different stakeholders
- Can be expanded with additional technical details for full documentation
- Maintains the agent-driven framing established in the README

### Design Considerations

- Use as hero section on documentation landing page
- Consider adding visual elements (icons, diagrams) to support each capability
- May want to expand each bullet point with more detailed explanations
- Could include links to deeper technical documentation for each capability
