# 📑 Anchor Documents (Internal Index)

This document serves as the **internal index** of all anchor documents guiding the ACD Monitor project.  
These anchors ensure methodological fidelity, operational discipline, and governance clarity.

2. **Mission Control**  
   - File: `docs/mission_control.md`  
   - Status: **IMMUTABLE**  
   - Content: Operational execution framework (milestones, queues, acceptance gates)  
   - Purpose: Defines how we move from spec → implementation.

3. **Governance**  
   - File: `docs/governance.md`  
   - Status: **IMMUTABLE**  
   - Content: Roles, responsibilities, and decision rules

   - Content: Technical milestones and baseline standards (Weeks 0-3)  
   - Purpose: Records progress and sets minimum bar for robustness.

5. **Release Checklist**  
   - File: `docs/checklists/release_checklist.md`  
   - Status: **IMMUTABLE**  
   - Content: Mandatory acceptance gates and regression tracking for all releases

7. **Product Specification**  
   - File: `docs/product_spec_v1.8.md`  
   - Status: **EVOLVING** (future: v1.9, v2.0, …)  
   - Content: Technical specification of platform implementation  
   - Purpose: Living document that evolves as development progresses.

8. **UI Anchor Document**  
   - File: `docs/UI-ANCHOR-DOCUMENT-v1.1.md`  
   - Status: **EVOLVING** (future: v1.2, v2.0, …)

## ⚠️ Note

- These documents are **internal only**. They are **not referenced in `README.md`** (public-facing).  
- Immutable anchors are never altered retroactively; updates require a new appendix or addendum.  
- Product specification evolves with each release cycle.
