## Active Risks

### Risk #001: Anchor Use-Case Drift
**Risk ID**: RISK-001  
**Category**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: MITIGATED  
**Owner**: Theo (AI Assistant)  
**Date Identified**: September 21, 2025  
**Last Updated**: September 21, 2025  

**Description**: The MVP has drifted from its primary anchor use-case of crypto exchanges to focus on regulators/banks/academia, representing a core scope failure.

**Impact**: 
- High risk of pilot failure
- Loss of credibility with crypto exchanges
- Complete product-market fit failure
- Wasted development time and resources

**Probability**: HIGH (Already occurred)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL  

**Root Cause**: 
- Success criteria "Goodharted" on regulatory statutes
- Triad bundle taxonomy replaced exchange-first lens
- Lack of anchor document reference in weekly milestones
- Audience assumption without validation

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- âœ… **Immediate Correction**: Pause all regulatory outreach
- âœ… **Exchange-Ready Bundle**: Create v0.1 for Head of Surveillance/CCO/Market Ops
- âœ… **Exchange Operations Queries**: Add 12+ exchange-specific queries
- âœ… **Anchor Guardrail**: Weekly "Exchange-first lens preserved this week?" check
- âœ… **Success Criteria Reset**: Focus on exchange operations metrics
- âœ… **Bundle Taxonomy Reset**: Exchange-focused bundle categories

**Controls**:
- Weekly anchor document validation
- Exchange-first lens check in all deliverables
- Success criteria validation against anchor requirements
- Audience validation for all outreach materials

**Triggers**:
- Any deliverables not targeting crypto exchanges
- Success criteria focused on regulatory compliance
- Bundle taxonomy using regulatory categories
- Audience assumptions without anchor validation

**Monitoring**:
- Weekly milestone review against anchor document
- Monthly scope alignment assessment
- Quarterly product-market fit validation

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- âœ… **Offline Fallback**: Comprehensive offline testing completed
- âœ… **Adapter Ready**: ChatbaseAdapter fully configured
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation implemented
- ðŸ”„ **Live Testing**: Pending paid account activation

**Controls**:
- Offline mock provider fully functional
- Comprehensive error handling
- Response consistency validation
- Fallback system testing

**Triggers**:

### Risk #003: Crypto Moment Validation
**Risk ID**: RISK-003  
**Category**: LOW  
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Owner**: Theo (AI Assistant)  
**Date Identified**: September 21, 2025  
**Last Updated**: September 21, 2025  

**Description**: Crypto moment validation is pending live data feeds, limiting production validation capabilities.

**Impact**:

- Potential accuracy issues with real data
- Delayed production deployment

**Probability**: LOW  
**Impact**: LOW  

**Root Cause**: 
- No access to live crypto data feeds
- Synthetic data testing only
- Production validation pending

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- âœ… **Synthetic Testing**: Comprehensive synthetic data testing completed
- âœ… **Infrastructure Ready**: Data collection infrastructure operational
- âœ… **Validation Pipeline**: Testing framework working perfectly
- ðŸ”„ **Live Validation**: Pending live data feed access

**Controls**:
- Synthetic data validation
- Infrastructure readiness
- Testing framework validation
- Production readiness assessment

**Triggers**:
- Live crypto data feed access
- Production deployment requirements
- Accuracy validation needs

**Monitoring**:
- Weekly synthetic testing review
- Monthly infrastructure readiness check
- Quarterly production validation assessment

### Risk #004: Exchange Operations Query Success Rate
**Risk ID**: RISK-004  
**Category**: HIGH  
**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Owner**: Theo (AI Assistant)  
**Date Identified**: September 21, 2025

- Insufficient exchange operations focus in provider

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- ðŸ”„ **Template Enhancement**: Add exchange-specific templates to OfflineMockProvider
- ðŸ”„ **Query Optimization**: Improve exchange operations query handling
- ðŸ”„ **Success Rate Target**: Achieve â‰¥80% success rate for exchange queries
- ðŸ”„ **User Experience**: Improve response quality for exchange operators

**Controls**:
