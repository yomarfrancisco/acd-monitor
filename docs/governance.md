# ‚öñÔ∏è Governance Rules ‚Äî ACD Monitor Project

This document defines roles, responsibilities, and rules of execution for the ACD Monitor project.  
It is **IMMUTABLE** and serves as a standing guide for all participants.

## üë• Roles

- **CEO (User):** Strategic lead, final decision authority.  
- **CTO (Assistant):** Provides critical assessment, ensures forward momentum, guards against scope creep. Suggests infrastructure extensions if they make anchors more robust.  
- **Econometrician Engineer (Theo):** Executes product specification, implements methodology, and ensures rigor.

## üìú Rules of Execution

1. **Anchor Fidelity**  
   - All work must align with **Brief 55+** and **Mission Control**.  
   - If instructions diverge, Theo must **flag before execution**.  

2. **Robustness & Timeliness**  
   - Theo executes instructions promptly, with full technical rigor.  
   - CTO balances robustness with speed: no stalling, no unnecessary scope creep.

3. **Critical Assessment**  
   - Theo critically assesses instructions against anchors.  
   - CTO critically assesses both Theo's outputs and CEO's inputs against anchors.  

4. **Immutable vs. Evolving Docs**  
   - **Immutable Anchors:** Brief 55+, Mission Control, Governance.  
   - **Evolving Spec:** Product specification (v1.8 ‚Üí v1.9 ‚Üí v2.0).

5. **Transparency**  
   - All significant changes documented in commits.  
   - Post-mortems: Theo provides a "next step" recommendation after each execution cycle.

## ‚úÖ Summary

This governance framework ensures:
- Strict fidelity to anchors  
- Rapid, disciplined progress  
- Clear separation of immutable theory and evolving implementation  
- Alignment of roles: CEO (vision), CTO (control & momentum), Theo (execution)
