# **Anchor Document v1.1: ACD – AI Compliance Assistant for Crypto Exchanges**

## **1. Purpose & Positioning**

We are building the **Algorithmic Coordination Diagnostic (ACD)** as an **AI compliance assistant** for the **crypto exchange industry**. The tool's mission is to provide **professional, evidence-driven, client-facing analysis** in the style of leading economic consulting firms, specifically designed for **operational and compliance teams** at crypto exchanges.

**Positioning**:
- **Primary**: AI compliance assistant for crypto exchange operations and compliance teams
- **Style**: Professional, evidence-driven, client-facing standard (RBB Economics benchmark)
- **Focus**: Operational pain-points and compliance workflows, not academic research or regulatory enforcement

---

## **2. Ordered User Stories (By Importance)**

### **Tier 1: Exchange Operations (Primary MVP)**
1. **Exchange Surveillance (Ops Teams)**
   - *"As a surveillance analyst, I need to detect coordination patterns in real-time to flag suspicious trading activity"*
   - *"As a market operations manager, I need to identify cross-venue coordination to assess market integrity risks"*
   - *"As a surveillance team lead, I need automated alerts for coordination patterns that require investigation"*

2. **Exchange Compliance (CCO / Regulatory Teams)**
   - *"As a Chief Compliance Officer, I need evidence-based reports on coordination risks for regulatory reporting"*
   - *"As a compliance analyst, I need to generate regulatory-ready documentation for market abuse investigations"*
   - *"As a regulatory liaison, I need to demonstrate proactive surveillance capabilities to regulators"*

### **Tier 2: Secondary Use Cases (Post-MVP)**
3. **Regulators (Enforcement Staff)**
   - *"As a market surveillance regulator, I need screening tools to identify potential coordination for investigation"*
   - *"As an enforcement officer, I need evidence bundles that meet admissibility standards"*

4. **Competition Economists (Expert Witnesses)**
   - *"As a competition economist, I need rigorous econometric analysis for expert testimony"*
   - *"As an economic consultant, I need methodology documentation that withstands peer review"*

5. **Competition Lawyers (Defense Advocates)**
   - *"As a competition lawyer, I need alternative explanations and counterfactual analysis"*
   - *"As a defense counsel, I need evidence that distinguishes coordination from competitive behavior"*

**Clarification**: **Operational and compliance pain-points are central** to the MVP. Economists and lawyers are secondary at this stage and will be addressed post-MVP.

## **3. Gap Analysis: Current State vs. Anchor Requirements**

### **3.1 Critical Drift Identified**

#### **Primary Audience Drift**
- **Anchor Requirement**: Crypto exchanges (Head of Surveillance, CCO, Market Operations)
- **Current State**: Regulators, central banks, academic institutions
- **Gap Severity**: **CRITICAL**
- **Evidence**: Pilot partner shortlist focuses on SEC, FCA, BaFin instead of Binance, Coinbase, Kraken

#### **Bundle Taxonomy Drift**
- **Anchor Requirement**: Exchange operations bundles (surveillance reports, case files, operator runbooks)
- **Current State**: Regulatory compliance bundles (court-ready evidence, enforcement support)
- **Gap Severity**: **CRITICAL**
- **Evidence**: "Regulator-Ready Bundle", "Bank-Ready Bundle", "Academic-Ready Bundle" instead of exchange-focused bundles

#### **Query Focus Drift**
- **Anchor Requirement**: Exchange-centric queries (spread floors, mirroring, latency-arb, order-book analysis)
- **Current State**: Regulatory compliance queries (statute references, enforcement support)
- **Gap Severity**: **CRITICAL**
- **Evidence**: Compliance queries focus on regulatory frameworks instead of exchange operations

#### **Professional Style Drift**
- **Anchor Requirement**: RBB Economics-style professional, evidence-driven, client-facing analysis
- **Current State**: Academic/regulatory tone with excessive technical jargon
- **Gap Severity**: **HIGH**
- **Evidence**: Bundles written for regulators rather than exchange operations teams

### **3.2 Root Cause Analysis**

#### **Success Criteria "Goodharting"**
- **Problem**: Success criteria were optimized for regulatory compliance rather than exchange operations
- **Evidence**: Metrics focused on "regulatory readiness" and "court admissibility" instead of "operational usability"
- **Impact**: System drifted toward regulatory enforcement rather than exchange compliance assistance

#### **Bundle Taxonomy Replacement**
- **Problem**: Triad bundle taxonomy (Regulator/Bank/Academic) replaced exchange-first lens
- **Evidence**: All bundle development focused on regulatory audiences
- **Impact**: Lost focus on primary MVP audience (crypto exchanges)

#### **Professional Style Misalignment**
- **Problem**: Academic/regulatory tone instead of professional consulting firm style
- **Evidence**: Bundles written for enforcement rather than operational decision-making
- **Impact**: Outputs not suitable for exchange operations teams
