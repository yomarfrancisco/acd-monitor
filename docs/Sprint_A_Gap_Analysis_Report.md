# **Sprint A Gap Analysis Report - Critical Scope Correction**

**Date**: September 21, 2025  
**Assessment Type**: Comprehensive Gap Analysis & Correction Plan  
**Prepared by**: Theo (AI Assistant)  
**Status**: URGENT - Immediate Correction Required  

---

## **Executive Summary**

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The ACD system has fundamentally drifted from its primary anchor use-case of **crypto exchanges** to focus on regulators/banks/academia. This represents a core scope failure that threatens pilot traction, credibility with exchanges, and product-market fit.

**Root Cause**: Success criteria were "Goodharted" on regulatory statutes and compliance frameworks, causing the triad bundle taxonomy (Regulator/Bank/Academic) to replace the exchange-first lens specified in the Anchor Document.

**Impact**: High risk of pilot failure, loss of credibility with crypto exchanges, and misalignment with product-market fit.

### **1.2 Current State Analysis**
- **Primary Audience**: Regulators, central banks, academic institutions
- **Focus**: Regulatory compliance and enforcement support
- **Style**: Academic/regulatory tone with excessive technical jargon

### **1.3 Evidence of Drift**
| Document | Anchor Requirement | Current State | Gap Severity |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|

## **5. Root Cause Analysis**

### **5.1 Success Criteria "Goodharting"**
- **Problem**: Success criteria were optimized for regulatory compliance rather than exchange operations
- **Evidence**: Metrics focused on "regulatory readiness" and "court admissibility" instead of "operational usability"
- **Impact**: System drifted toward regulatory enforcement rather than exchange compliance assistance

### **5.2 Bundle Taxonomy Replacement**
- **Problem**: Triad bundle taxonomy (Regulator/Bank/Academic) replaced exchange-first lens
- **Evidence**: All bundle development focused on regulatory audiences
- **Impact**: Lost focus on primary MVP audience (crypto exchanges)

### **5.3 Professional Style Misalignment**
- **Problem**: Academic/regulatory tone instead of professional consulting firm style
- **Evidence**: Bundles written for enforcement rather than operational decision-making
- **Impact**: Outputs not suitable for exchange operations teams

---

## **6. Impact Assessment**

### **6.1 Pilot Traction Risk**
- **High Risk**: Pilot partners (regulators) not aligned with primary use-case (exchanges)
- **Impact**: Pilot failure, loss of credibility, misalignment with product-market fit
- **Mitigation**: Immediate correction to exchange-first focus

### **6.2 Credibility Risk**
- **High Risk**: Loss of credibility with crypto exchanges due to regulatory focus
- **Impact**: Difficulty securing exchange partnerships, reduced market adoption
- **Mitigation**: Professional style alignment with RBB Economics benchmark

### **6.3 Product-Market Fit Risk**
- **High Risk**: Misalignment between product capabilities and market needs
- **Impact**: Reduced market adoption, competitive disadvantage
- **Mitigation**: Re-anchoring to exchange operations and compliance workflows
