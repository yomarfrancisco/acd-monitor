# Achievements Log (Immutable Anchor)

This document records the technical milestones achieved each week. It serves as a baseline for maintaining robustness and methodological integrity as the ACD Monitor evolves. Once logged, entries are not modified — only appended.

---

## Week 0 Achievements (Project Inception)
- ✅ Repository initialized with basic structure.
- ✅ Core anchors established: Brief 55+, Mission Control, Product Spec v1.8.
- ✅ Governance rules created (docs/governance.md, docs/ANCHORS.md).
- ✅ CEO/CTO/Theo role clarity established.
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline bootstrapped (GitHub Actions initial setup).

---

## Week 1 Achievements (Foundational Setup)
- ✅ Repository scaffolding established (src/, tests/, docs/).
- ✅ Synthetic data generator scaffolded (scripts/generate_golden.py).
- ✅ CI/CD hardened with Black, Flake8, pytest.
- ✅ Anchor verification: docs committed and pushed.
- ✅ Test discovery confirmed working.

---

## Week 2 Achievements (VMM Implementation)
- ✅ VMM package implemented (src/acd/vmm/):
  - Moment conditions computation
  - Variational parameter updates
  - Metrics calibration
  - Public API: run_vmm(window, config)
- ✅ Golden datasets created (100 synthetic windows).
- ✅ Test suite (14 tests) passing.
- ✅ Documentation: docs/vmm.md.
- ⚠️ Spurious regime rate: ~10% (above 5% target).
- ✅ Structural stability: 0.199 (within threshold).

---

## Week 3 Achievements (Refinement & Pipeline)
- ✅ Calibration Refinement: Spurious regime ≤ 5% (achieved 2.0%).
- ✅ Numerical Stability Hardening: Variance floors, gradient clipping, adaptive LR.
- ✅ Performance Optimization: Median runtime 0.005s (400x better than target).
- ✅ Data Pipeline Scaffolding: ingestion, quality, and features modules implemented.
- ✅ Integration & Evidence Artifacts: schema updated with VMM outputs.
- ✅ CI/CD hardened with full lint/test/reporting.
- ✅ 76 tests run: 75 passed, 1 xfail (Platt scaling calibration).

---

## Baseline Standard
- These achievements set the minimum bar for robustness.
- Minor regressions are acceptable as complexity increases.
- Significant regressions (e.g., spurious >10%, runtime >5s, major instability) must be flagged explicitly.

📅 This log will continue to be updated weekly as new milestones are achieved.
