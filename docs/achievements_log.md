# Achievements Log (Immutable Anchor)

This document records the technical milestones achieved each week. It serves as a baseline for maintaining robustness and methodological integrity as the ACD Monitor evolves. Once logged, entries are not modified — only appended.

---

## Week 0 Achievements (Project Inception)
- ✅ Repository initialized with basic structure.
- ✅ Core anchors established: Brief 55+, Mission Control, Product Spec v1.8.

- ✅ CEO/CTO/Theo role clarity established.
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline bootstrapped (GitHub Actions initial setup).

---

## Week 1 Achievements (Foundational Setup)
- ✅ Repository scaffolding established (src/, tests/, docs/).
- ✅ Synthetic data generator scaffolded (scripts/generate_golden.py).
- ✅ CI/CD hardened with Black, Flake8, pytest.
- ✅ Anchor verification: docs committed and pushed.
- ✅ Test discovery confirmed working.

- ✅ VMM package implemented (src/acd/vmm/):
  - Moment conditions computation
  - Variational parameter updates
  - Metrics calibration
  - Public API: run_vmm(window, config)
- ✅ Golden datasets created (100 synthetic windows).
- ✅ Test suite (14 tests) passing.
- ✅ Documentation: docs/vmm.md.
- ⚠️ Spurious regime rate: ~10% (above 5% target).
- ✅ Structural stability: 0.199 (within threshold).

---

## Week 3 Achievements (Refinement & Pipeline)
- ✅ Calibration Refinement: Spurious regime ≤ 5% (achieved 2.0%).
- ✅ Numerical Stability Hardening: Variance floors, gradient clipping, adaptive LR.
- ✅ Performance Optimization: Median runtime 0.005s (400x better than target).
- ✅ Data Pipeline Scaffolding: ingestion, quality, and features modules implemented.
- ✅ Integration & Evidence Artifacts: schema updated with VMM outputs.
- ✅ CI/CD hardened with full lint/test/reporting.
- ✅ 76 tests run: 75 passed, 1 xfail (Platt scaling calibration).
- ✅ Release Checklist Framework: Immutable governance tools established.

---

## Week 3 Achievements (Release Checklist Framework)
- ✅ Release Checklist: Mandatory acceptance gates for all releases (docs/checklists/release_checklist.md).
- ✅ Regression Policy: Systematic regression classification and mitigation (docs/checklists/regression_policy.md).
- ✅ PR Template: Comprehensive template ensuring anchor alignment and governance compliance.
- ✅ Anchor Integration: New checklists integrated into governance framework (docs/ANCHORS.md).
- ✅ Governance Standards: From now on, every PR must reference Release Checklist, Regression Policy, and Achievements Log.

---

## Week 4 Achievements (Evidence Pipeline & Pipeline Hardening)
- ✅ Evidence Bundle Integration: Complete implementation with VMM outputs and calibration artifacts.
  - EvidenceBundle class with VMM outputs (regime_confidence, structural_stability, dynamic_validation_score)
  - Calibration artifacts from Week 3 (calibration/{market}/{yyyymm}/)
  - RFC3161 timestamping for regulatory compliance
  - Schema validation passes in CI with full artifact reproducibility
- ✅ Golden Dataset Expansion: Enhanced with realistic coordination mechanisms.
  - Leader-follower dynamics and staggered reaction patterns
  - CDS spread data and SA bank competition reference datasets
  - 190 total windows across 6 dataset types
  - Clear separation demonstrated in validation
- ✅ Pipeline Hardening: Extended data ingestion and quality thresholds.
  - Independent analyst feeds with validation (analyst_id, analysis_type, confidence_score)
  - Regulatory disclosures with compliance checking (disclosure_id, compliance_status)
  - Market data providers with freshness monitoring
  - Hardened quality thresholds: timeliness ≤ 12h (critical: ≤ 4h), consistency ≥ 95%
  - Quality metrics ≥ 0.8 on golden datasets achieved
- ✅ Documentation & Transparency: Comprehensive evidence pipeline documentation.
  - docs/evidence_pipeline.md with bundle structure and methodology
  - Golden dataset generation and validation process documented
  - Reproducibility workflow and acceptance gates established
  - All Week 4 requirements met and validated

---

## Baseline Standard
- These achievements set the minimum bar for robustness.
- Minor regressions are acceptable as complexity increases.
- Significant regressions (e.g., spurious >10%, runtime >5s, major instability) must be flagged explicitly.
- **NEW**: All releases must pass Release Checklist acceptance gates.
- **NEW**: All regressions must be classified and documented per Regression Policy.
- **NEW**: Evidence pipeline must maintain ≥ 0.8 quality metrics on golden datasets.
