# Release Checklist (Immutable Anchor)

> **IMMUTABLE**: This document defines the mandatory acceptance gates for all ACD Monitor releases. Once established, these gates cannot be modified without governance approval.

## 🎯 **Purpose**

This checklist ensures every release maintains the dual pillars of Brief 55+:
- **ICP (Independent Coordination Protocol)**: Market structure analysis
- **VMM (Variational Method of Moments)**: Continuous monitoring engine

## 📋 **Pre-Release Gates**

### **1. Anchor Alignment Check**

- [ ] **Mission Control Alignment**: Development follows established milestones
- [ ] **Governance Compliance**: Changes respect role definitions and decision rules
- [ ] **Achievements Log Updated**: New milestones documented with evidence

### **2. Core Functionality Gates**
- [ ] **VMM Engine**: All tests pass (≥95% success rate)
- [ ] **VMM Calibration**: Spurious regime rate ≤ 5% (competitive datasets)
- [ ] **VMM Stability**: ELBO variance ≤ 5% across reproducibility runs
- [ ] **VMM Performance**: Median runtime ≤ 2s, p95 ≤ 5s for standard windows
- [ ] **Data Pipeline**: Ingestion, quality, and features modules operational
- [ ] **Schema Validation**: All JSON schemas pass validation in CI

### **3. Quality Assurance Gates**
- [ ] **Code Quality**: flake8 clean (0 errors)
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: ≥90% coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] **Documentation**: All new features documented
- [ ] **Type Hints**: All new code includes proper type annotations

- [ ] **Dependencies**: No security vulnerabilities in requirements
- [ ] **Performance**: No significant performance regressions
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Backward compatibility maintained where required

## 🚨 **Regression Policy Compliance**

### **Acceptable Regressions**
- **Minor Performance**: <10% runtime increase (documented with justification)

- **Documentation**: Minor formatting changes (no content loss)

### **Unacceptable Regressions (Immediate Flag)**
- **VMM Accuracy**: Spurious regime rate > 5%
- **VMM Stability**: ELBO variance > 5%
- **VMM Performance**: Runtime > 5s (p95)
- **Core Functionality**: Any breaking changes to public APIs
- **Data Integrity**: Loss of data validation or quality checks

### **Regression Documentation**
- [ ] **Impact Assessment**: Severity and scope documented
- [ ] **Root Cause**: Technical explanation provided
- [ ] **Mitigation Plan**: Timeline and approach for resolution
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear gates for regression resolution

## 📊 **Release Metrics**
