# Anchor Drift Assessment - Critical Scope Correction Required

**Date**: September 21, 2025  
**Assessment Type**: Critical Scope Drift Analysis  
**Prepared by**: Theo (AI Assistant)  
**Status**: URGENT - Immediate Correction Required  

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The MVP has fundamentally drifted from its primary anchor use-case of **crypto exchanges** to focus on regulators/banks/academia. This represents a core scope failure that threatens pilot traction, credibility with exchanges, and product-market fit.

**Root Cause**: Success criteria were "Goodharted" on regulatory statutes and compliance frameworks, causing the triad bundle taxonomy (Regulator/Bank/Academic) to replace the exchange-first lens specified in the Anchor Document.

**Impact**: High risk of pilot failure, loss of credibility with crypto exchanges, and misalignment with product-market fit.

## Anchor Document Requirements vs. Current State

### Primary Audience Specification
**Anchor Document**: Crypto exchanges (Head of Surveillance, CCO, Market Operations)  
**Current State**: Regulators, central banks, academic institutions  
**Gap Severity**: **CRITICAL**

### Core Analytics Requirements
**Anchor Document**: ICP/VMM + validation tuned to crypto, exchange ops workflows  
**Current State**: Generic regulatory compliance frameworks  
**Gap Severity**: **CRITICAL**

### Agent Queries Requirements
**Anchor Document**: Exchange-centric queries (spread floors, mirroring, latency-arb, order-book analysis)  
**Current State**: Regulatory compliance queries (statute references, enforcement support)  
**Gap Severity**: **CRITICAL**

### Bundle Outputs Requirements
**Anchor Document**: Exchange operations bundles (surveillance reports, case files, operator runbooks)  
**Current State**: Regulatory compliance bundles (court-ready evidence, enforcement support)  
**Gap Severity**: **CRITICAL**

## Root-Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause: Success Criteria "Goodharting"
**Evidence**: Phase-4 success criteria focused on:
- "≥3 statutes explicitly cited" 
- "100% mandate alignment"
- "Compliance-oriented, evidence-driven tone"

**Impact**: This caused the system to optimize for regulatory compliance rather than exchange operations.

### Secondary Root Cause: Triad Bundle Taxonomy
**Evidence**: Week 4 deliverables created:
- Tier 1: Financial Regulators
- Tier 2: Central Banks  
- Tier 3: Academic/Industry

**Impact**: This replaced the exchange-first lens with a regulatory-first lens.

### Tertiary Root Cause: Regulatory Language Focus
**Evidence**: Refinement work focused on:
- "prudential oversight"
- "systemic risk monitoring"
- "enforcement support"

**Impact**: This shifted focus from operational efficiency to regulatory compliance.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Lack of Anchor Document Reference**: Weekly milestones didn't include anchor document validation
2. **Success Criteria Drift**: Metrics optimized for regulatory compliance rather than exchange operations
3. **Audience Assumption**: Assumed regulatory audience without validating against anchor document
4. **Bundle Taxonomy**: Created regulatory-focused bundle categories instead of exchange-focused ones

---

## Impact Assessment

### Pilot Traction Risk: **HIGH**
- **Current State**: Bundles focus on regulatory compliance, not exchange operations
- **Risk**: Exchanges will reject bundles as irrelevant to their operational needs
- **Mitigation**: Immediate pivot to exchange-focused bundles and workflows

### Credibility Risk: **CRITICAL**
- **Current State**: System appears designed for regulators, not exchanges
- **Risk**: Loss of credibility with crypto exchange community
- **Mitigation**: Immediate demonstration of exchange-focused capabilities

### Product-Market Fit Risk: **CRITICAL**
- **Current State**: Misaligned with primary target market (crypto exchanges)
- **Risk**: Complete product-market fit failure
- **Mitigation**: Immediate correction to exchange-first approach

### Resource Waste Risk: **HIGH**
- **Current State**: Significant effort invested in regulatory-focused deliverables
- **Risk**: Wasted development time and resources
- **Mitigation**: Repurpose regulatory work for exchange compliance use cases

## Immediate Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Emergency Correction (This Week)
1. **Pause all regulatory outreach** until exchange-ready bundle is complete
2. **Create Exchange-Ready Bundle v0.1** for Head of Surveillance/CCO/Market Ops
3. **Add 12+ exchange operator queries** to test suite
4. **Update agent templates** for exchange operations focus

### Phase 2: Systematic Correction (Next Week)
1. **Repurpose regulatory work** for exchange compliance use cases
2. **Create exchange-specific test scenarios** and stress tests
3. **Update documentation** to focus on exchange operations
4. **Validate against anchor document** requirements

### Phase 3: Validation & Launch (Week After)
1. **Test exchange-ready bundles** with mock exchange scenarios
2. **Validate agent queries** against exchange operations workflows
3. **Launch exchange-focused pilot** outreach
4. **Monitor anchor drift** with weekly guardrails

---

## Governance Recommendations

### Immediate Guardrails
1. **Weekly Anchor Check**: "Exchange-first lens preserved this week?"
2. **Success Criteria Reset**: Focus on exchange operations metrics
3. **Bundle Taxonomy Reset**: Exchange-focused bundle categories
4. **Audience Validation**: All deliverables must target crypto exchanges

### Long-term Governance
1. **Anchor Document Reference**: Include in all weekly milestone reviews
2. **Success Criteria Validation**: Regular validation against anchor requirements
3. **Audience Validation**: Regular validation of target audience alignment
4. **Scope Drift Monitoring**: Weekly assessment of scope alignment

---

## Conclusion

This assessment reveals a **critical scope drift** from the anchor document's primary focus on crypto exchanges to regulatory compliance. The impact is **high risk** for pilot traction, credibility, and product-market fit.

**Immediate action required**: Pause regulatory outreach, create exchange-ready bundle v0.1, and implement anchor drift guardrails.

**Success depends on**: Rapid correction to exchange-first approach and systematic validation against anchor document requirements.
